# Introduction 

The applicative motivation is thin structures and shells, common in engineering for their advantageous properties of being lightweight, efficient on material cost, and are used to assemble large stuctures. However, "Despite their ubiquity, they remain challenging from the point-of-view of computational mechanics. One of the reasons for this is their sensitivity to perturbations in materials, kinematic constraints, and shell geometry itself due to manufacturing imperfections." @RoperHakulaButler2025.
